I am from a tier 3 college, currently 2nd year(2024). I don't like rat races and competitions. I prefer collaboration and gamification instead.
I started learning about computers and softwares when I joined college, My first language was python, I made quite lot of projects on that. 
I realized that despite have problem in remembering and mugging up things at school, I am quite good at this programming thing. I love building logic, creating projects, solving real life problems.
I am a very practical person, I dont like theory much.
This is where I can show the world what I can do.
I am very lazy and stubborn too haha and often try to become a perfectionist sometimes.
